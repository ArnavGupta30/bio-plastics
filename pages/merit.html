        <h1>Pros of Bio Plastics</h1>
        <p>
          Bioplastics are made from plant raw materials instead of petroleum
          oil, the raw material used to make conventional plastics. No oil
          drilling, coal mining or fracking are needed to make plant-based
          bioplastics.
          <br><br>
          Plant raw materials are renewable and sustainable unlike oil which is a limited and finite resource.
          <br><br>
          The carbon footprint of manufacturing bioplastics is reportedly 75% lower than that of PET and PS alternatives i.e. their manufacture is kinder to the environment.
          <br><br>
          Bioplastics are non-toxic and wonâ€™t leach chemicals into food or soil. According to a study conducted by The National Center for Biotechnology Information in America; plastics (including BPA free plastics) leach estrogen-like chemicals into food. There are also many studies that show that plastics can leach toxic chemical additives into the environment and landfills. Compostable bioplastics break down into harmless natural and safe compounds.
          <br><br>
          Bioplastics are biodegradable and compostable.
          <br><br>
          There are a variety of zero waste end of life options for bioplastics. Bioplastics can be recycled, they can be cleanly incinerated and industrially composted.  This is makes bioplastics a great material for food packaging as used packaging does not require cleaning since food and packaging can be composted or incinerated together. An additional benefit of composting is that nutrients from food waste are returned to soil to nurture new plants, improving soil fertility and food security.
