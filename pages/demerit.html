        <h1>Cons of Bio Plastics</h1>
        <p>
          Growing demand for bioplastics creates competition for food sources, contributing to the global food crisis. This is a misleading argument commonly used against bioplastics. The raw material for bioplastics is an industrial-grade corn which is not grown for human consumption.  Recent technological developments in the bioplastics industry have shown that that it is possible to make biodegradable bioplastics  from hemp, seaweed and other plants. As the market grows, we can expect to see many new innovative production approaches. Humans have always used plants for non food purposes.

          Bioplastics won’t biodegrade in a landfill. Landfills are not designed to break anything down. They are huge compacted piles of waste that we don’t know what to do with. No organic waste breaks down well (if at all) in a landfill. The bottom line is we shouldn’t be sending any organic waste to landfill and should design a circular system which includes composting and ideally doesn’t require any landfills.<br>Unfortunately landfills remain the last stop for many plastics. We believe the benefits of a lower carbon footprint to produce bioplastic products and the fact that they offer the potential for composting as a new way of achieving zero waste sets them apart. Plus, they don’t leach toxic chemicals; there are many studies showing that plastics leach harmful chemicals, in and out of landfills.
          <br><br>
          Bioplastics encourage people to litter more. We hope not and do not encourage littering with our products. (Don’t let us catch you!) Littering is a human behaviour, which requires education, raised awareness and a good infrastructure to be reduced.
          <br><br>
          Bioplastics contaminate plastic recycling streams. This is another myth. Recycling systems are excellent at separating different materials, and need to be because there are a great deal of different plastic types and they all need to be separated before they have any chance of being recycled. Compostable bioplastics do not pose more of a threat than any other of the many types of plastic. Bioplastics can also be recycled and the recycling market will grow as bioplastics are used more and more.

          Bioplastics are not the answer to marine litter. We agree. You can read why bioplastics are not the answer to marine litter <a href="https://greenhome.co.za/biodegradable-plastics-are-not-the-answer-to-reducing-marine-litter-says-un/">here</a>
