        <h1>What are Bio Plastics?</h1>
        <p>
          Bioplastics are plastic materials produced from renewable biomass
          sources, such as vegetable fats and oils, corn starch, straw,
          woodchips, sawdust, recycled food waste, etc. Some bioplastics are
          obtained by processing directly from natural biopolymers including
          polysaccharides (e.g. starch, cellulose, chitosan and alginate) and
          proteins (e.g. soy protein, gluten and gelatin), while others are
          chemically synthesised from sugar derivatives (e.g. lactic acid) and
          lipids (oils and fats) from either plants or animals, or biologically
          generated by fermentation of sugars or lipids. In contrast, common
          plastics, such as fossil-fuel plastics (also called petro-based
          polymers) are derived from petroleum or natural gas.
          <br><br>
          Few commercial applications exist for bioplastics. Cost and performance remain problematic. Typical is the example of Italy, where biodegradable plastic bags are compulsory for shoppers since 2011 with the introduction of a specific law. Beyond structural materials, electroactive bioplastics are being developed that promise to carry electric current. Bioplastics are used for disposable items, such as packaging, crockery, cutlery, pots, bowls, and straws. Biopolymers are available as coatings for paper rather than the more common petrochemical coatings.
          <br><br>
          Bioplastics called drop-in bioplastics are chemically identical to their fossil-fuel counterparts but made from renewable resources. Examples include bio-PE, bio-PET, bio-propylene, bio-PP, and biobased nylons. Drop-in bioplastics are easy to implement technically, as existing infrastructure can be used. A dedicated bio-based pathway allows to produce products that can not be obtained through traditional chemical reactions and can create products which have unique and superior properties, compared to fossil-based alternatives.
