      <div>
        Starch-Based
        <p>
          Simple bioplastic derived from corn starch. Often mixed with biodegradable polyesters to make it stronger and more durable.
        </p>
        Cellulose-Based
        <p>
          Produced using cellulose esters and cellulose derivatives.
        </p>
        Protein-Based
        <p>
          Produced using protein sources such as wheat gluten, casein and milk
        </p>
        Bio-derived Polyethylene
        <p>
          Polyethylene that has been produced from the fermentation of raw agricultural materials like sugarcane and corn rather than fossil fuels
        </p>
        Aliphatic Polyesters
        <p>
          A collection of bio-based polyesters including PLA, PHB, PGA, among others. They are all more or less sensitive to hydrolytic degradation, aka they are sensitive to water, and can be mixed with other compounds.
